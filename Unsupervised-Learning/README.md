# Unsupervised Learning 🔍

Unsupervised Learning is a category of Machine Learning where models learn patterns and structures from **unlabeled data** — that is, data without predefined output labels. The primary goal is to **discover hidden patterns**, **groupings**, or **structures** in the input data.

Unlike supervised learning, there’s no explicit feedback during training, which makes unsupervised learning especially useful in **exploratory data analysis**, **anomaly detection**, and **data compression**.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **No Labels**: The algorithm is provided with input data only (no output labels).
- **Self-discovery**: It tries to find patterns, groupings, or underlying structure in data.
- **Use Cases**: Market segmentation, recommendation systems, image compression, gene expression clustering, anomaly detection, etc.

## 📂 Types of Unsupervised Learning

### 1. Clustering 🧩
Grouping data points based on their similarity or distance in feature space.

#### ✅ Algorithms Covered:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters either bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive).
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: Groups points closely packed together and marks outliers as noise.

#### 📌 Example Use Cases:
- Customer segmentation in marketing
- Grouping news articles by topic
- Identifying communities in social networks

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction 🧠
Reducing the number of features (dimensions) while preserving the essential structure of the data.

#### ✅ Algorithms Covered:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Projects data to lower dimensions by capturing maximum variance.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: A non-linear method for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.
- **Autoencoders (if included)**: Neural networks trained to reconstruct their input; useful for compressing and denoising data.

#### 📌 Example Use Cases:
- Data visualization
- Feature extraction
- Noise reduction
- Preprocessing for supervised models

## 🧪 How to Use the Notebooks

Each notebook in this folder:
- Introduces the algorithm and its real-world significance.
- Loads and preprocesses a dataset (often synthetic or from `sklearn.datasets`).
- Applies the algorithm step-by-step.
- Visualizes the results with libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`.
- Analyzes strengths and limitations of the method.
